# Crime_models
Implementation of several crime prediction models, just run model_comparison.py can see the model performances.

CRF_RNN_model:

please refer to paper: Shuai Zheng, et al. "Conditional random ﬁelds as recurrent neural networks". In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 1529–1537, 2015

TCP_model:

please refer to paper: Xiangyu Zhao and Jiliang Tang. "Modeling temporal-spatial correlations for crime prediction". In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pages 497–506. ACM, 2017

NN_CCRF_model:

Is the newly proposed model for predicting crime numbers using a neural network based CCRF model.

And paper describing NN_CCRF_model is just accepted by IJCAI 2019, which named "Neural Network based Continuous Conditional Random Field for Fine-grained Crime Prediction"
